            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>WhatsApp chat exports are plain text files that are difficult to read and analyze. I wanted to create a tool that could parse these files, display them in a user-friendly format, and provide interesting insights and analytics, including a fun "rizz-rating" feature.</p>

            <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
            <ul class="tech-stack">
                <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Flask</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The application is a simple web app powered by a Python back-end. The user uploads their WhatsApp chat export, which is then processed by a Python script. The script parses the chat file, performs analysis, and generates a report. The results are then displayed on a web page.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I was the sole developer for this project. I designed and built both the front-end and the back-end, including the chat parsing and analysis logic.</p>

            <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Parsing the complex and sometimes inconsistent format of WhatsApp chat exports.</li>
                <li>Developing a "rizz-rating" algorithm that is both fun and somewhat accurate.</li>
                <li>Creating a simple and intuitive user interface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>This project was a great way to practice my Python and web development skills. I learned a lot about text processing, data analysis, and building simple web applications with Flask.</p>
