            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>A political candidate needed a professional and engaging website to promote their campaign and connect with voters. The website needed to be fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to update with new information.</p>

            <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
            <ul class="tech-stack">
                <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>Next.js</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Firebase</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The website is built with Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered web applications. This allows for fast page loads and improved SEO. Firebase is used for hosting and as a simple back-end for storing and retrieving data.</p>
