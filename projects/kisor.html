            <h2>Kisor – AI Storybook Generator</h2>
            <p class="one-liner">An AI-powered storybook generator that creates personalized stories for children.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Parents often struggle to find new and engaging stories for their children. I wanted to create a tool that could generate unique and personalized storybooks based on a child's interests and preferences.</p>

            <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
            <ul class="tech-stack">
                <li>Flutter</li>
                <li>Firebase</li>
                <li>OpenAI GPT-3</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The app uses a Flutter front-end to gather input from the user, such as the child's name, interests, and desired story length. This information is then sent to a back-end service that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate a story. The generated story is then displayed in a beautifully formatted storybook layout.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I was the sole developer for this project. I was responsible for the UI/UX design, front-end development, and integration with the OpenAI API.</p>

            <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Prompt engineering to generate high-quality and age-appropriate stories.</li>
                <li>Designing a user-friendly and engaging storybook interface.</li>
                <li>Managing the costs associated with using the OpenAI API.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>This project was a great introduction to the world of generative AI. I learned a lot about prompt engineering, working with large language models, and building AI-powered applications. I also gained valuable experience in Flutter and mobile app development.</p>
