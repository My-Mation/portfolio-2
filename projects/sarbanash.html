            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>I wanted to create a fast-paced and challenging 2D shooter that would test players' reflexes and strategic thinking. I also wanted to experiment with a unique gameplay mechanic to make the game stand out from other titles in the genre.</p>

            <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
            <ul class="tech-stack">
                <li>Unity</li>
                <li>C#</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The game is built with Unity and uses a simple entity-component-system (ECS) architecture. The game logic is written in C#, and the assets are all custom-made.</p>
            <!-- Placeholder for SVG architecture diagram -->

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I was the sole developer for this project. I was responsible for all aspects of development, including game design, programming, art, and sound.</p>

            <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing a unique and engaging gameplay mechanic.</li>
                <li>Creating all the art and sound assets from scratch.</li>
                <li>Optimizing the game for performance on a variety of devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>This project was a great way to learn the ins and outs of game development with Unity. I gained valuable experience in game design, programming, and asset creation. I also learned a lot about the challenges of indie game development and the importance of perseverance.</p>
